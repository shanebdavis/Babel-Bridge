    using readline for shell

    added support for infix binary operator presedence resolution:

        USAGE:

              binary_operators_rule :any_rule_name, :operands_pattern, operators

            Where "operators" is an array of operators, ordered by precedence such as: ["+", "-", "*", "/"].

            The last operators in the array are matched first.

            You can also group operators into the same precedence level: [["+", "-"], ["*", "/"]]

            Operators in the same precedence level are matched left-to-right. 

        TODO: 

            The core code supports right-to-left, too, I just haven't implemented a way to express it in the binary_operators_rule's operators parameter

        MATCHING:

              binary_operators_rule :any_rule_name, :operands_pattern, ["+", "-", "*", "/"]

            matches the same string as:

              rule :any_rule_name, many(:operands_pattern,/[-+*\/]/)

        PARSE TREE:

            The resulting parse-tree consists of 1 or more instances of the :any_rule_name rule's varient class. Each node has methods for easy acess to:

                left -> the left operand node
                right -> the right operand node
                operator -> the operator as a symbol
                operator_node -> the operator node
