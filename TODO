TODO-FEATURE: :pre_delimiter option for many()
TODO-FEATURE: The "expecting" feature is so good I wonder if we should add the ability to make and apply suggestions to "repair the parse".
  This would need:
    a) default values for regex termainals
      . string terminals are their own default values
      . default values for regex should be verified to match the regex
    b) an interactive prompter if there is more than one option

TODO-IMPROVEMENT: "Expecting" should show line numbers instead of char numbers, but it should only be calculated
  on demand. This means we need a smarter formatter for our possible-error-logging.

TODO-BUG: "Expecting" doesn't do the right thing if a "dont" clause matched
  Should say "something other than #{the don't clause}"
  Ideally, we would continue matching and list all the possible next clauses that would allow us to continue

IDEA: could use the "-" prefix operator to mean "dont":
  -"this"
  -:that
  -match(:foo)
  -many(:foo)
